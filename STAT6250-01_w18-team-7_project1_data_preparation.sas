[Research Question 1] Which year has the most change in open, closed or merged schools? (Rationale: This would help to show the trend of the enrollment.)
[Research Question 2] What are the top five school districts with the most school closings or openings?(Rationale: This would help to find the factors of low or high enrollment.)
[Research Question 3] Can the closure, open and merge of schools predict local demographic structure and economic status change? (Rationale: This would help to analyze the relationship of schools and surrounding environment.)
[Reason for Choice] I received a notice from my local school district last year. The notice informed me that two public elementary schools may be closed in 2018 for low enrollment. I am interested in the reasons for the closing. I hope that data analysis can indicate what factors may cause the low enrollment resulting the closure of schools.
